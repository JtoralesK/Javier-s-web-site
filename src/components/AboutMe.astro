        Welcome to a little glimpse into my world! My name is Javier Torales, and
        Iâ€™m a passionate Java Fullstack Developer with a flair for creating seamless
        and efficient web applications. My journey in the world of programming began
        a few years ago, and it has been a thrilling ride ever since. From the moment
        I wrote my first line of code, I was hooked on the endless possibilities
        that the world of software development offers. I recently completed a two-year
        technicature in programming, a period during which I immersed myself in various
        programming languages, frameworks, and tools.
        <br />
        This experience not only solidified my technical skills but also ignited
        a deep-seated passion for continuous learning and innovation in the tech
        space. <br /><br />
        As a Fullstack Developer, I specialize in Java for the backend, ensuring
        robust and scalable server-side applications. For the frontend, I wield React
        with finesse, crafting dynamic and responsive user interfaces that provide
        a seamless user experience. I thrive on the challenges that come with integrating
        the frontend and backend, creating cohesive and efficient applications that
        meet user needs and exceed expectations.
        <br />
        One of the projects I am particularly proud of involves creating an interactive
        web application where I had to manage videos without relying on third-party
        services like YouTube. This project was not just a technical challenge but
        also a learning opportunity, pushing me to explore new solutions and think
        outside the box. I have documented this journey.
